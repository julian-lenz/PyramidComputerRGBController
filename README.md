# PyramidRGBController
Helperclass for controlling the RGB light controller from Pyramid Computers

Uses System.IO.Ports, therefore **only running on Windows**.

This is part of a group project for the bachelor1 thesis where we experiment with using UPOS (Pos for .NET 1.14) for controlling the hardware of a *[self checkout terminal](https://pyramid-computer.com/polytouch/flex/sco-self-checkout-kiosk/)*

Further steps are to wrap the controller class in a Pos for .Net Service Object
